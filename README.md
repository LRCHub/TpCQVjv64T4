```lrc
[00:15.32] There must be lights burning brighter somewhere
[00:22.45] Got to be birds flying higher in a sky more blue
[00:30.22] If I can dream of a better land
[00:34.17] Where all my brothers walk hand in hand
[00:38.20] Tell me why, oh why, oh why can't my dream come true
[00:46.69] Oh, why
[00:50.19] 
[00:52.75] There must be peace and understanding sometime
[00:59.68] Strong winds of promise that will blow away the doubt and fear
[01:07.69] If I can dream of a warmer sun
[01:11.75] Where hope keeps shining on everyone
[01:15.64] Tell me why, oh why, oh why won't that sun appear
[01:40.14] 
[01:31.14] We're lost in a cloud with too much rain
[01:39.84] We're trapped in a world that's troubled with pain
[01:47.64] But as long as a man has the strength to dream
[01:53.28] He can redeem his soul and fly
[02:08.28] 
[02:05.24] Deep in my heart there's a trembling question
[02:12.91] Still I am sure that the answer, answer's gonna come somehow
[02:20.67] Out there in the dark, there's a beckoning candle, yeah
[02:28.12] And while I can think, while I can talk
[02:32.02] While I can stand, while I can walk
[02:35.74] While I can dream, please let my dream come true, oh
[03:01.74] 
[02:50.76] Right now, let it come true right now
[02:58.77] Oh, yeah
